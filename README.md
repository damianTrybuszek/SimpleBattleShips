# SimpleBattleShips
 

This is a simple version of the game Battleships. Application allows a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

The program creates a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

    1x Battleship (5 squares)
    2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The player enters coordinates of the form "A5", where "A" is the column and "5" is the row, to specify a square to target. 
Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.


To play the game you should clone the repo, build the project using your favourite IDE and just enjoy the game.
